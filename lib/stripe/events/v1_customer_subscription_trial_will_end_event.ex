defmodule Stripe.Events.V1CustomerSubscriptionTrialWillEndEvent do
  @moduledoc """
  Occurs three days before a subscription's trial period is scheduled to end, or immediately when a trial is ended early (for example, with `trial_end=now` or when a Customer Portal plan change ends a trial). If a trial is shortened so that fewer than three days remain, this event can fire immediately, including during the same transaction that collects payment. Before sending payment-reminder communications from this webhook, check the subscription status and latest invoice to determine whether payment has already been collected.
